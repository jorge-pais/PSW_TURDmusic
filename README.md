# T.U.R.D : Totally Unified, Relatable and Deliverable Music

This is the project developed during the first semester (4th year) in the context of the "Software Design" course unit.
T.U.R.D. music provides users with a simple way to organize local music files, fetch metadata automatically and play them in the chosen media player.

## Instalation

See [Instalation Instructions](https://gitlab.com/psw_22_231/1meect02/t02_1/-/wikis/Installation-Instructions) in the wiki.

## Prerequisites
To get the application up and running, it is necessary to have installed some sort of media player software on your machine. We recommend using VLC media player, which is free, lightweight and open-source. 

In order to fetch metadata from music files the [fpcalc utility](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint) is required. The executalbe for Win32 can be downloaded freely from AcoustID's website, and is available in most package managers for linux distributions. 
This application only support Windows and Linux environments, and requires Java to be installed.
